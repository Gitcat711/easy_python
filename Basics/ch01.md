## Chapter 1.

### What is Python?
- Python is a _high level, interpreted , interactive and object-oriented_ programming language.
- It's designed to be easily readable as it frequently uses english keywords and few syntactical constructions. Here's the **print** method: 

  ```print("Let's learn Python")```
- Python is processed at **runtime** by the interpreter, which means that Python programs don't need to be compiled pre-execution(_I will get down to more details on this_)
- The interactive side of Python means you can use *python prompt* to interact with the interpreter directly to create programs!
- Since Python is an Object-Oriented programming language, it supports an object-oriented style of programming which encapsulates code within objects.

### Why learn Python?
Python was designed in a way that is easy to understand and to read. It uses English keywords and doesnt't require long variable declarations or the use of curly braces for functions or classes.

For example a ```for``` loop for Python using self-explained English keywords:
```python
numbers = [67, 89, 100]
for i in numbers:
  print(i)

# Output: 67 89 100
```

Python is also considered as economical programming, savings lines of code as compared to other langauges. For similar problem or task, Python can often require 3-5 times less code than Java, and up to 10 times less code than C++. Also being an __Object Oriented__ programming language, it really act as beginner's stepping stone to learn other object-oriented programming languages, & can help us adapt to other programming environment.
