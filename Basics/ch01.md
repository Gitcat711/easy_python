## Chapter 1.

### What is Python?
- Python is a _high level, interpreted , interactive and object-oriented_ programming language.
- It's designed to be easily readable as it frequently uses english keywords and few syntactical constructions. Here's the **print** method: 

  ```print("Let's learn Python")```
- Python is processed at **runtime** by the interpreter, which means that Python programs don't need to be compiled pre-execution(_I will get down to more details on this_)
- The interactive side of Python means you can use *python prompt* to interact with the interpreter directly to create programs!
- Since Python is an Object-Oriented programming language, it supports an object-oriented style of programming which encapsulates code within objects.

### Why learn Python?
Python was designed in a way that is easy to understand and to read. It uses English keywords and doesnt't require long variable declarations or the use of curly braces for functions or classes.

For example a ```for``` loop for Python using self-explained English keywords:
```python
numbers = [67, 89, 100]
for i in numbers:
  print(i)

# Output: 67 89 100
```

Python is also considered as economical programming, savings lines of code as compared to other langauges. For similar problem or task, Python can often require 3-5 times less code than Java, and up to 10 times less code than C++. Also being an __Object Oriented__ programming language, it really act as beginner's stepping stone to learn other object-oriented programming languages, & can help us adapt to other programming environment.

### Python 2
The final version of Python 2 came out in 2010, and despite Python3 being latest hotshot of the language, many programmers still uses Python v2.7. One of the advantage of Python 2 is that it has been around far longer than v3, therefore therefore there's more technical support and help available. Minor difference between v2 & v3 is that in v2, `print` is treated as statement instead of a function, therefore it eliminates use of passing arguments through paraentheses, for example:

```python
print "Hello Python!"
```

### Python 3
Python3 was released in 2008 with the goal to simplify Python, making it more easier to use. The goal of this new Python version was to also change the way a language handles strings, consequently enabling it to meet demands of the language today.

Python3 is the first release which is incompatible with previous python versions, which is why some people still use Python2, as they find some packages and libraries not working with latest Python versions. 

In Python3, you must pass items to print explicitly to the function in parentheses as folows:
```python
print("This is new Quirks of Python3")
```
Python3 is contemplated as an improved version of Python2, with fewer mistakes, and easier for beginners to understand and use. Let's dive into latest version. As a beginner, the best bet is **Pyhton3**. This is a standard which is advancing faster and you don't have to worry at all about porting a whole Python2 application to Python3(the main reason why python 2 hung around for so long).
